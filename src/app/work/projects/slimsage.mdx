## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the wroted code was clean and maintainable. The state management used is provider, which is the first global state management i used. But used provider is pretty fun because the configuration and flow not to be complicated like BLoC. I challanged how to make the app responsive in other devices, but is not completed haha, and then the problem when interact with API like error handling in UI.

## Outcome

The app is completed for pass the midterm exam at Alterra academy MSIB batch 5. The app can used on android devices
