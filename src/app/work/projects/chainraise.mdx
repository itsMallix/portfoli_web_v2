## Overview

Smart contract implementation of crowdfunding Ethereum blockchain-based platform using Proof of Stake algorithm.

## Key Features

- **Smart Contrac**: created smart contracts that will be used in the program as fully decentralized program flow controllers.
- **Create Campaign**: Allows user to create campaign with smart contract and will be writen to the immutable blockchain.
- **Donate**: Allow user to contribute to a campaign with smart contract interaction, donate with crypto currency.
- **Airdrop**: After donating, user can claim their airdrop tokens and can be used to participate in the staking pools.
- **Staking**: Stake the token and let them grow over time, more staking, more rewards.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **React JS**: For web3 frontend development.
- **Solidity**: For developing the smart contract.
- **Thirdweb**: For Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **Sepolia Ehereum**: The blockhcian used for database, store the data into testnet blockchain.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the wroted code was clean and maintainable. Find the documentation about Web3 programming and blockchain are little difficult and challanged to learn, especially developing the smart contract and ensure the safety or security of smart contract.

## Outcome

The app is completed for pass the study S1 Teknologi Informasi at Universitas Jember. The app currently running on Sepolia testnet blockchain.
